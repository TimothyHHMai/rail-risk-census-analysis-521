    "# 3. Data Sources & Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the relationship between population density and rail safety, we selected two primary datasets that allow for a granular geospatial analysis at the county level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Source A: Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Data (Form 54)**\n",
    "* **Publisher:** Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) / Department of Transportation (DOT)\n",
    "* **Period:** 2012 - Present (Filtered for schema consistency)\n",
    "* **URL:** [DOT Open Data Portal](https://data.transportation.gov/Railroads/Rail-Equipment-Accident-Incident-Data-Form-54-/85tf-25kj/about_data)\n",
    "* **Justification & Selection Criteria:**\n",
    "    * **Authoritative Record:** This dataset is the federal standard for reportable rail accidents.\n",
    "    * **Reporting Threshold:** We acknowledge that this dataset excludes minor incidents. Inclusion is based on a monetary reporting threshold (adjusted annually for inflation, approx. $12,000+ in recent years), ensuring our analysis focuses on events with significant economic impact or infrastructure damage.\n",
    "    * **Temporal Cut-off:** We restricted our analysis to data starting from **2012**. While the FRA updated their reporting schema in June 2011, we excluded the entire transition year to ensure maximum data integrity and consistent definitions for key variables like `TERRITORY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Source B: Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (2023)**\n",
    "* **Publisher:** USDA Economic Research Service (ERS)\n",
    "* **Period:** 2023 Edition\n",
    "* **URL:** [USDA ERS Data Products](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes)\n",
    "* **Justification (USDA vs. US Census):**\n",
    "    * **Superior Granularity:** Standard US Census data relies on simple population counts. The USDA RUCC system classifies counties into a 9-point scale based on distinct *environmental* factors.\n",
    "    * **The \"Adjacency\" Factor:** Crucially, this dataset distinguishes rural counties by their **adjacency to metropolitan areas**. This is vital for our analysis, as we hypothesize that rural counties adjacent to major transit hubs face different rail traffic risks than isolated rural counties—a nuance that standard census counts would miss."

Our conclusions therefore apply specifically to *significant* rail accidents rather than all operational irregularities.\n",
